        <h1>Hotel Cancellation Prediction</h1>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using machine learning.
            The objective was to identify high-risk reservations and reduce revenue loss.
        </p>

        <h2>Business Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Cancellation rates increased from 15% to 37%, putting €4M annual revenue at risk.
            The goal was to build a predictive model to flag risky bookings.
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
            <li>Feature engineering</li>
            <li>Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)</li>
            <li>Evaluation using ROC-AUC & F1-score</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The best model achieved 82% accuracy and improved early detection of cancellation risk.
