          <h3>Project Summary</h3>

          <p><strong>Context:</strong>
            Haro Hotel experienced a surge in booking cancellations from 15% in 2017 to 37% in 2018.
            This increase put approximately €4.02M in annual revenue at risk. The trend is structurally
            driven by the digitalization of room reservations, which offers high flexibility
            but results in low customer commitment.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Goal:</strong>
            The primary objective was to reduce the hotel booking cancellation rate from 37% to 20%
            within a six-month period. This involved identifying key factors driving cancellations,
            predicting future cancellation risks for upcoming reservations, and strategizing
            targeted interventions to recover at-risk revenue.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Process:</strong>
            The analytical approach followed a structured workflow: business understanding,
            data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Diagnostic analysis
            was performed using Python’s statsmodel to identify drivers, followed by developing
            a tree-based classification machine learning model (Gradient Boosting with
            GridSearch CV) to predict high-risk bookings.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Output:</strong>
            The model successfully detects 77% of cancellations, enabling proactive interventions
            such as milestone-based confirmations and partial deposits for high-risk bookings.
            Retaining 60% of these predicted cancellations could reduce the overall rate to 20%
            and recover over 35% of at-risk revenue. These data-led strategies turn cancellation
            management into a controllable strategic lever.

          <h3>Scope of Work</h3>

          <ul class="scope-list">
            <li>Developed a tree-based Gradient Boosting classification model to detect 77% of high-risk cancellations for upcoming hotel reservations.</li>
            <li>Identified five key cancellation drivers—including online bookings and long lead times—explaining 83% of total cancellation risk.</li>
            <li>Analyzed 2018 performance to reveal a 21.9% year-over-year cancellation increase, putting €4.02M in annual revenue at risk.</li>
            <li>Formulated a retention strategy to recover 35% of at-risk revenue by reducing the final cancellation rate to 20%.</li>
